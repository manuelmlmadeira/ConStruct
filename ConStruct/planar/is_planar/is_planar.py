def is_planar(g):
    """
    The top of the left-right algorithm for testing planarity of graphs.

    We can refer its basic concepts and notations in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    g : networkx.Graph
        A simple undirected graph of NetworkX.

        If g has four interfaces size(), order(), nodes(), and
        g[v] or neighbors(v), then is_planar does not require NetworkX.

            1. size() : returns the number of edges as int
            2. order() : returns the number of vertices as int
            3. nodes(): returns all vertices in g as iterable
            4. g[v] or neighbors(v) : returns the neighbors of v as iterable
                    If you would like to exchange to neighbor(), then
                    just edit in the function lr_algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the graph g is planar otherwise False

    The framework of depth-first search (DFS) in the left-right algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    g : networkx.Graph
        A simple undirected graph of NetworkX.

    root : any hashable or immutable variable
        A vertex in g for starting DFS, or DFS root.

    dfs_heights : collections.defaultdict
        This maintains DFS height for each vertex, or the distance
        (the number of vertices on the path) from the vertex root.
        The DFS height of each root is 0.
        In addition, it is used as a checklist visiting vertices, then
        each unvisited vertex is initialized as -1.

        It is not necessary to use defaultdict, else dict such as a map
        from V to a domain [-1, 0, 1, ..., n], where V is the vertex set of g
        and n is the number of vertices in g, may be appropriative.
        However, since lr_algorithm immediately terminates as soon as
        finding a violation against the left-right criterion,
        so we have specified defaultdict.

        Noting that dfs_heights is the call by sharing, it is also
        accessed for checking all components in g are completely traversed.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the connected component reachable from root is planar,
        otherwise False.
