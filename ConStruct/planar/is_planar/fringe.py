class fringe:
    r"""The class of a fringe of a tree edge

    This class maintains fringe of a tree edge (x, y).
    The definition of the fringe can be found in [1]_.

    Roughly, from Definition 2.2 in [1]_:
        The fringe Fringe(e) of a tree edge e = (x, y) is defined by

        Fringe(e) = {f in E \ T : f >= e and low(f) < x}.

            - E : edge set of a given graph
            - T : tree edge set of a DFS tree (T is subset of E)
            - f : any back edge
            - low : destination vertex if for a back edge
            - Each binary relation compares between heights or the distance
              from the DFS root.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        In other words, the fringe of a tree edge e = (x, y) is the set of
        all back edges linking a vertex in the subtree rooted at y and
        a vertex strictly smaller than x.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    !!!Caution!!!
        The above is excerpt from the literature, we have a little correction.
        We omit "strictly", thus our fringe contains back edges incoming to x.

    Attributes
    ----------
    fops : collections.deque of fringe_opposed_subset
        The fringe of a tree edge (x, y) mainly consists of
        the fringe-opposed subsets for each tree edges outgoing from y.
        More strictly, it also contains one-sided single fringe-opposed
        subsets for each back edges outgoing from y.

        The number of elements in fops is less than or equal to
            n1 (the number of tree edges outgoing from y) +
            n2 (the number of back edges outgoing from y).

        This is important when we evaluate time complexities.
        If for each backtracking on DFS, the total time complexity of
        merging fringes is in O(n1 + n2), then is_planr is in linear time.

    H : The static pointer to the fringe-opposed subset containing a back edge
        with the highest dfs_height in self.fops under __lt__.

    L : The static pointer to fringe-opposed subset containing a back edge
        with the lowest dfs_height in self.fops under __lt__.

    Methods
    _______
    merge(other)
        Merge other fringe into self one.

    prune(dfs_height)
        Prune back edges in which the DFS height is equal to dfs_height.

        Notes
        -----
        We would like to cofirm correctness.
        There are two facts easily checkable:

            - At each raising an exception, we can construct Kuratowski
              subgraph (a subdivision of K5 or K3,3), from the lowest
              back edge or an edge with the onion violation (see
              _make_onion_structure_example.png) and the two-sided
              fringe-opposed subset. Anyways, the induced subgraph of union of
              edges in four fundamental cycles makes a Kuratowski subgraph.
              Thereby, if given graph is planar, we never return False
              as non-planar.
                  (see _merge_t_alike_edges and _make_onion_structure)
                  (see also An_extraction_of_Kuratowski_subgraph.png)

            - The remaining is the case we are given non-planar graph,
              and incorrectly return True as planar. It's never happend.
              Since after all tree edges are processed, all back edges
              could have been colored either 1 (left) or -1 (right) when
              it's pruned, depending on which side of the fringe-opposed
              subset it belongs to.
              This coloring admits the F-coloring defined in [1]_.
                  (see _align_duplicates and prune)

        This sketch is leading to valid proofs, isn't it?

        Notes
        -----
        We have to prove two statements;

            2) in O(n1) time, where n1 is the number of tree edges outgoing y.

            The second one is obvious. We note that the number of back
            edges outgoing from y are omitted, since our graph is simple.

            The first one is...
            First of all,
                - we can assume that self fringe conforms the left-right
                  criterion, and

                  the onion structure.
            If self.fops consists of one fringe-opposed subset (fop) then
            obvious, since it just check the highest in the both sides.
            If self.fops has at least two fops containing the back
            edge of dfs_height, each inner fop must be one-sided and
